# SGA Website Migration

The purpose of this project is to migrate the Student Government Association's website from a third-party platform to a self-hosted solution. This new website will primarily display information, provide links to additional media, include a feedback form, and offer a way for users to sign up for an email newsletter.

## Technologies
frontendï¼š
- React.js: Allows for the use of reusable components so that big chunks of code don't have to be written again in different files.
- Tailwind CSS: Instead of writing an extensive list of styles in CSS files, Tailwind CSS allows styling through classes.
  
backend:
- mongodb: Good for storing data, uses a JSON like schema to keep track of objects and information, easy to setup and to add/delete/update objects in the databse
- Node.js: allows you to use JavaScript for both the frontend (in the browser) and the backend (on the server). Also scalability features + can run npm
- Express.js: minimal and lightweight. Express has a powerful and flexible routing system that lets us define RESTful Api's too with lots of ease and is very flexible
## Deployment

## Setting up the development environment

### BACKEND

1. Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (Download from nodejs.org)
MongoDB 
Express.js

2. Install Dependencies: `npm install` This will install all required Node.js dependencies from package.json.

3. Set Up Environment Variables:
   
Inside the backend folder, create a .env file: `touch .env`

Open .env and add the following:
```
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/usersdb
PORT=3000
```

4. Start MongoDB

`brew services start mongodb-community`

5. Run the Server

`npm start` or if using nodemon use `npm run dev`

You should see:
```
Server running on http://localhost:3000
MongoDB connected successfully
```
